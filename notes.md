# Powering Higher Ed Through Community

25 minutes, leave ~5 minutes for questions.

## Introduction

Powering Higher Ed Through Community - Apply community to how content is managed.

Howdy. Welcome to the chapel. :)

* Who all here is involved with higher education in any way?
* How about another large organization with many moving pieces?
* Who's a member of a community?

Cool. Most hands. :) Hopefully this provides some food for thought.

I'm going to offer up some ties between the concept of community and the general concept of a University. Some of this has guided things we've done at Washington State University. Some of it is kind of this pie in the sky that we're trying to push toward. There will be time for questions afterward, so if anything strikes you as strange or cool, keep track of it.

While preparing for this talk, I tried to find some nice ways to tie in my experiences with community from my time living in Portland, working with WordPress, and now working at Washington State University. Before getting to how community can be used to power the web, we need to step back and kind of explore the various parts of community that surround us.

We can then cover the definition of community, the definition of University, and I'll give you an overview of how I think one is necessary to really power the other one forward in the future.

## My story.

Community is how I got into WordPress. Community is how I got to Washington State University. And community is how I'm standing here in a chapel talking to you about community.

A few years ago, I attended my first WordCamp Portland right here in the Eliot Center, my first WordCamp even. I had no idea what I was doing, but it cost $20 and I got lunch and a beer, so net positive, right?

I fell in love with the community pretty quickly. I met Zack Tollman, who was just about to start at 10up. I started going to meetups. I applied and got hired at 10up. I started contributing to WordPress. I took a leap of faith and moved from Portland to boo-foo Eastern Washington to work at WSU. I contributed more to WordPress. I became a core comitter.

I can pretty much attribute everything along the way to the communities I'm a part of and a general willingness to be open. Open in sharing what I was doing or learning, and open to new experiences.

## What does community mean?

Wikipedia: "A community is a social unit of any size that shares common values."

Latin Communis: "Things held in common"

The boundaries of a community can sometimes be a physical location, but they can also be an idea.

Today we're in Portland as part of the WordCamp Portland community. Portland itself has several meetups forming the Portland WordPress community. Each of those is a community in itself.

Today there's also a WordCamp in Seattle. I went to the developer camp earlier this year, as well as the one in Vancouver. I've become fond of our Pacific NorthWest community.

Inside WordPress, you have people focused on core development, theme review, plugins, support, planning events. All of these various communities inside one large group that each play their part in powering almost a quarter of the Internet.

## What does University mean?

And then there's University.

Wikipedia: Derived from "universitas magistrorum et scholarium", which roughly translates to "community of teachers and scholars".

A University is a community!

And there are various parts to that. There's often a powerful alumni community. An athletics community. Each of the individual colleges, departments within the colleges, student groups, dorms, etc... So many communities inside the community.

Just like all the various communities in WordPress combine loosely together to define WordPress and the total WordPress community, the various communities inside the university combine to also define the total.

Even though conceptually the University itself is a community and looks and feels like a community, people are still protective of their work. Here's where a bit of caution and planning comes in.

Communities without cross pollenation become silos.

## Silos

And these aren't the tall grain silos you see driving through Eastern Washington, they're huge underground silos. Big pits in the ground. As you get deeper and deeper into the silo of your community, the light starts to disappear. You quickly lose track of what other individual communities are doing. You lose a benefit of being part of a larger community.

"Organizations that cannot breach the silo walls when necessary are ill-equipped to achieve breakthroughs of any kind whatsoever. While they may wish for it, it’s as if they are instinctively aware of Barthes’ assertion that the product of interdisciplinary collaboration can’t be owned by any one discipline. In a world where competition trumps collaboration, just managing to poke through the silo walls at all would be a breakthrough." - http://www.miscmagazine.com/breakthroughs-belong-to-no-one/  will novosedlik

"It’s not the raw creativity or herculean intellect of an inspired individual that solves problems. It’s the interaction between that individual and others that leads to epiphany. Most scientific and artistic innovations or breakthroughs emerge from joint thinking, impassioned conversations, constructive conflict and shared struggles among different people." - http://www.miscmagazine.com/breakthroughs-belong-to-no-one/  will novosedlik

## Avoiding Silos

So how do you avoid silos at a University. And how do you avoid them when there may be a natural inclination to dig into silos once your focused on some super specific work?

There are two answers here, I think:

* Brand - A unique identifier.
* Grand Challenges - A way of guiding everyone forward in a common mission.

The first one is actually much easier than the second.

How do provide this unique identifier in a community that can sometimes have a waryness of central, seemingly top-down administrative support?

And how do you do this and still foster the growth of individual communities?

We can look at Conway's law for caution: "organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations"

A brand to manage via community
A web to manage via community
Helping people share their story
University Communications
Marketing, web.
