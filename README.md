# Powering Higher Ed Through Community

WordCamp Portland - October 24, 2015

It sounds cool when you hear a university is powered by WordPress, but what does that really mean? A website is a website, content is content, and WordPress is really just another way to manage it all.

Why WordPress? Sometimes because it’s the right answer. Sometimes because it’s free.

The true power is community. And if you can apply that community to how content is managed, you may find yourself with a solution that can carry change throughout an organization.
